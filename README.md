# phongLightingModular

An example of the Phone Lighting Model with Model View Matrix and Perspective Matrix written with WebGL2, GLSL, and ES6 to be locally viewed (static files with no server needed). Although we are not using actual ES6 "modules", the "modularity" of this example allows you to see a separation of concerns that makes learning WebGL a bit more palatable than many of the examples seen in the wild.
